You can also see your previous posts or write a new one.:

![get tags by id](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviaowen1/E-Commerce-Back-End/main/Assets/GET%20ALL%20TAGS%20BY%20ID.png)


You can also create a tag using a POST request as you will see below:

![create tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviaowen1/E-Commerce-Back-End/main/Assets/CREATE%20TAG.png)


And this is then reflected when you send a new GET request for "Get All Tags":

![updated all 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviaowen1/E-Commerce-Back-End/main/Assets/UPDTED%20GET%20ALL%20TAGS%201.png)


This can then be updated using a PUT request, in order to do this, you will need to enter the ID number you wish to update in the URL location, as below:


![update request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviaowen1/E-Commerce-Back-End/main/Assets/UPDATE%20TAG.png)


This will then again reflect when you send a new GET request for "Get All Tags":


![updated get all](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviaowen1/E-Commerce-Back-End/main/Assets/UPDATED%20GET%20ALL%20TAGS%202.png)


You can also delete a request, which again will require you to enter the ID you wish to delete into the URL and click send:


![delete request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviaowen1/E-Commerce-Back-End/main/Assets/DELETE%20TAG.png)


As you can see below, this will then ammend and update on the next GET request for "Get All Tags"
